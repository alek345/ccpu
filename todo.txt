TODO list for ccpu

Add ORG pseudo-op, this opcode sets the current offset used to generate labels, useful for creating offset, or pointers to memory

Finish string render IVT 1h a3, tip: create a single char push, which also handles moving the cursor, then use that function to finish string rendering

Implement i/o ports, design a disk controller, that handles atleast floppies.
	io port instructions
	OUTXY	- Output y to port address x
	OUTAX	- Output a to port address x
	OUTAY	- Output a to port address y
	
	Also maybe a serial port, this port prints by default to stdout, but one should be able reroute this via an cmd argument
