TODO list for ccpu

Add ORG pseudo-op, this opcode sets the current offset used to generate labels, useful for creating offset, or pointers to memory

Add some sort of stack, with push and pop instructions, remember empty pop(pop but not set data in stack to a register)

Add keyboard input of somesort, maybe through a interrupt system.

Write an internal rom, this rom contains information, like the BIOS data area and probably a interrupt vector table.
