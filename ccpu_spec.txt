ccpu spec
--------

Genral specs:

Big-endian
8-bit
Maximum of 64k mem, more might be possible through "hardware hacks"


Registers:

5 internal registers

8-bit GPRS
A - Accumaltor
X - GPR
Y - GPR

16-bit register
D - Address register
IP- Points to next instruction to excecute

A, X, Y and D are directly controlled by the user
IP is indirectly controlled through instructions

RAM layout:

0x0000 - 0x00FF - I/O data area
0x0100 - 0x02FF - ROM
0x0300 - 0x03FF - IVT
0x0400 - 0x04FF - Stack
0x0500 - 0x05FF - Call level stack (used by jmp and ret)

0x1000 - This is where the user starts

0x8000 - 0x92C0 - Video memory

IVT:
Total of 128 entries
1 word per entry
This word is the address where the interrupt handler is located

I/O data area:

0x0000 - 32 bytes - Keyboard buffer
0x0021 -  1 byte  - Keyboard buffer index
0x0022 -  1 byte  - Stack offset
0x0023 -  1 byte  - Call level stack offset


Video:

80x30 text mode display
Each character is 8x12 pixels

Memory mapped from 0x8000 and out

Supports 16 colors (VGA mode 3h colors):
Black		0x0		Dark gray	0x8
Blue		0x1		Light blue	0x9
Green		0x2		Light green	0xA
Cyan		0x3		Light cyan	0xB
Red			0x4		Light red 	0xC
Magenta		0x5		Light mag.	0xD
Brown		0x6		Yellow		0xE
Light gray	0x7		White		0xF

Each charcter entry is two bytes long

Following this format

First byte ascii character
Second byte color, high nibble is background, low nibble is foreground
